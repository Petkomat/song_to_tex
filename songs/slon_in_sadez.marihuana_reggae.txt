Marihuana reggae
<C>   <G> <C> (2x)

<C>I'm a little narcoman
I like the hashish and <G>mari<C>huan
I know i'm gonna die one of this days
At least I will go with a smile on my face.

<G>But, <C>but the things aren't easy so
Cause it is prohibited by <G>the <C>law
So you can find me in bushes and in park
Hiding with my joints in the dark

<C>I like the goverment, I like the police,
But most of I like <G>canna<C>bis (2x)

I'm not sayin you should smoke all day
But one or two times it should be OK
Cause with or without the grass 
you allways have the people just sitting on their ass

If it's legal to drink wine and beer
Why is ganja a subject of fear
We are, we are providing education
To bring marihuana legalisation

I like the goverment, I like the police,
but most of I like cannabis (3x)
