Taliban reggae
<D>   Halo Kabul, <A> <D> 
<D> We are the Elephant and Fruit reagge ensemble <A> <D>

I'm a little Taliban
I come from the country of Afganistan.
If i'm gonna die in a big krach
It is the will of the all mighty Alah.

I didn't have the money for the vacation
So, i joined the terrorist organisation
I learn to fly a plane from a friend
but he forgot to teach me how to land.

<D>I love my papa, I love my mama,
but most of all I <A>love O<D>sama. (2x)
 
And I am feeling the most happy
when I hear the scream of jappy
I don't care much where I'm going
beacuse I drive 747 Boeing.

I hope that USA will remember
the date of 11th of September.
We choose this day beacuse of this
it's the international day of piece.

I love my papa, I love my mama,
but most of all I love Osama. (2x)

And I would be a real nice lad,
if I weren't in Džihad.
And just beacuse of this one attack
Americans want to bomb us back.

I know that reprecussions would come
but it's a great commercial for Islam.
It's not much but now I can
see my house on the CNN

I love my papa, I love my mama,
but most of all I love Osama. (2x)

Oooooo<E>oooooo

<E> I love my papa, I love my mama,
but most of all I <H-7>love O<E>sama. (3x)

Oooooo<F#>oooooo
